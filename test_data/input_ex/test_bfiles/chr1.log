83534 (of 83534) markers to be included from [ hapmap1.map ]
979 individuals read from [ hapmap1.ped ] 
979 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
484 cases, 495 controls and 0 missing
979 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 83534 SNPs
979 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.99441
